This is an independent exploratory study analyzing the 2018 elections for Senate in the United
States. It contains end-to-end data cleaning, exploratory statistical analysis, and data visualizations. It integrates data from three secondary data source (1) the website FiveThirtyEight’s election forecast, (2) the context for the 2018 election from MIT Data Lab, and (3) historic Senate results from MIT Data Lab.  

The goal of this project was to answer the following questions:
1. What is 538’s deluxe forecast over time for the odds of victory of candidates in the
two major parties (Republican and Democrat) in Wisconsin?

2. What is the distribution of estimated voteshare for Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic
nominee in Arizona? And how it varied over time?

3. Who is the candidate who is neither a Republican or Democrat who has the highest
probability of victory at any point in any of 538’s models?

4: How does the election context data compare to the results from New York Times?

5. How did democrat party’s eletoral support change between 2016 and 2018?

6. What is the association of (i) the “shift right” from 2012 to 2016 against (ii) the share
voting for a republican candidate in 2018?

7. Design a function to analyze the trend of democratic and republican vote share across states from 2012 to 2018 (use Arizona as an example)
